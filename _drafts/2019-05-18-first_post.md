***Make a blog with GitHub, they said. It'll be easy, they said.***

For a long, *long* time, I have wanted to try my hands on blogging. This first post will serve as both a test post and a chronicle of me setting up a semi-functioning blog with github.

The first part, that is to say, the setting up part is pretty straight forward. I just followed the steps that GitHub layed out [here](https://pages.github.com/).

1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`
2. Clone it.
3. Create an index file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Done! Here are the results:
